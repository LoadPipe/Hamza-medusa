                Hamza marketplace operates entirely using cryptocurrency for all

            <Text mb={4}>
                Sellers on our marketplace accept the following cryptocurrencies
                as payment:

                When purchasing an item, buyers must ensure they have the
                correct cryptocurrency accepted by the seller and the correct
                amount available in their wallet to complete the payment. Since
                sellers directly accept cryptocurrency, there are no conversion
                rates or fiat currency involved in the transaction. Any order
                that is canceled or eligible for a refund will be refunded to
                the same wallet address used for the purchase, and in the same
                cryptocurrency that was originally used for payment.

            <Text mb={4}>
                The marketplace charges a fixed service fee of 5% which is
                already included in all listing prices. The platform’s fee
                includes the escrow service, which is mandatory to provide
                additional protection during the transaction until the goods are
                delivered and the transaction is completed.
            </Text>
            <Text mb={4}>
                Additionally, there will be a transaction (gas) fee based on the
                specific cryptocurrency you are using. Gas fees vary depending
                on network congestion at the time of the transaction and are
                required to process the payment on the blockchain. Any
                applicable gas fees will be clearly displayed before you confirm
                the payment. Make sure to account for these fees when sending
                your cryptocurrency.

            </Text>
            <Text mb={4}>
                Cryptocurrency transactions are{' '}
                <strong>final and irreversible</strong>. Once you make a payment
                and the funds are placed in escrow, the transaction is binding.
                After the goods are delivered and the escrow is released to the
                Seller, funds cannot be refunded or returned, so it is important
                to carefully review the transaction before finalizing it.
            </Text>
            <Text mb={4}>
                Please double-check all payment details, including the amount,
                shipping address, and the item description, before confirming a
                purchase. Any disputes must be resolved through the
                marketplace’s dispute resolution process, as outlined in these
                Terms.
